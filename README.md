# CSE-470-Library-Management-System
This project is 'Library Management System'. Here users can have their books and read it online like a library.To use the system the user and the admin need to login to the system. After login the user will request for the books and the admin will check the user and the books whether the books are here in the system or not ,if the book is not in the system then the admin will send notification that the book will arrive after some time. But if the books are available then the admin will give access to the user who has requested for the books. Again there will be deadline to use the books. After the deadline the user have to request again for the same book. This system is mainly a library but in a online platform.
